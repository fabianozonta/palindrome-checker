# Palindrome Checker

This JavaScript application checks whether a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards. The program prompts the user to enter a word and then displays a message indicating whether the word is a palindrome. If the word is not a palindrome, the program shows both the original word and its reversed version.

## Features

- **Check Palindrome:** Determines if a word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version.
- **Display Results:** Alerts the user whether the word is a palindrome.
- **Show Reversed Word:** If the word is not a palindrome, displays both the original word and its reversed version.
